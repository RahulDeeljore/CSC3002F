The sender is never throttled due to lacking of receiver buffer space.

Total length is 56, so Payload is  56-20 = 36

Time to live, Identification and Header checksum

Source IP address – We are sending from same source 
Destination IP address- We are contacting same destination
Header Length-  stays the same since we are using IPv4
Version - IPv4 is always used
Differentiated Services – Protocol stays the same 
Upper Layer Protocol – Protocol stays the same

Version - IPv4 is always used
Differentiated Services – Protocol stays the same(ICMP)
Upper Layer Protocol – Protocol stays the same(ICMP)

Identification – Each packet has a different ID
Header Checksum- Header changes so does checksum
Time to live (traceroute increments each subsequent packet)

The nearest router will be in the same subnet and will have a common IP address component.

0x61e7 (25063)

The TTL will remain unchanged because the first hop router is always the same.

Identification for all ICMP TTL-exceeded replies will change because it is assigned a unique value.
